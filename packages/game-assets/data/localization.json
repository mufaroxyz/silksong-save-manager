  "SHOPKEEP_CURSED": "Oh my, what a state you're in! You look like you're one breath away from keeling over dead!<hpage>I will continue to live, madam, but I am indeed afflicted. A parasite has taken root within my shell... Perhaps you have something that could help me? A medicine?<page>Mmm, not so sure I stock anything like that. You should ask Pavo there. It's his job to give directions and such, so he may have some useful advice.<page>In the meantime... shopping itself is a type of medicine, isn't it? You should buy something now. Given your condition, this might be your last chance!",
  "COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_TALK_1": "<page=S>Ughhh! What-what is this? Your body is all twisting, creaking! Horrid fiend inside! <hpage>A parasite has lodged deep inside my shell. It has taken some strength of will to keep its thrashing at bay.<page=T>With a shell like such, you cannot be taking no deliverings! Infect the goods you would-would!<hpage>Very well, couriers. If I somehow manage to remove the parasite, I may return to offer aid.",
  "BELLHERMIT_MEET": "What do you want, slave?<hpage>Slave? I am a traveller, stranger, not a slave.<page>Grnk. Exactly what a slave would say. Begone!",
  "GREETER_REPEAT2_ACT3": "<hpage>Soon, Pavo, I shall calm the chaos. Please guard these bugs safe till then.<page>Of course, dear resident! Of course! Know all our faith, and our wishes go with you.",
  "SHOP_ITEM_ROSARYSTRING_M_DESC": "Loose rosaries will escape your pockets at the worst of times, and I'm a deft claw at stringing them tight! I can string you a whole necklace, safe and stylish.",
  "COURIER_SHORT_QUEST_ACCEPTED": "<hpage>I have taken your wish, Tipp. If I find your brother safe, I'll be sure to send him back this way.<page>My many thanks, miss saving! You are brave-brave. Same as brother! My faith goes all with you!",
  "PINSMITH_QUEST_REPEAT": "Up there, in that Citadel, the fabled oil is waiting. Bestow it upon this fine pinmaster and your blade shall sing louder yet.<hpage>I will find the oil, pinmaster. Keep your skills sharp.",
  "DOCTOR_CURSE_OFFER": "Now now! What's all this? Infested are you, bzzt?<page>Do you even know who I am? Why, &#8216;tis the great Yarnaby, genius physician, unfairly outcast, who now towers before you!<hpage>I apologise for intruding upon your work, but if you are the skilled physician you claim, I ask your assistance.<hpage>A parasite has wormed its way inside of me. Its roots twist and pull inside my shell, draining my strength. If you possess the skills and tools, I would see it removed.<page>Bzzt! Well, well! So you're a special, sickly specimen, are you?! That changes matters, yes. Turns them on their head!<page>Let me see. Hm. Not haunted, indeed. No Silk-sickness. But something strange has certainly clawed its way in!<page>These &#8220;roots&#8221; that torment you so... I'm not altogether familiar with them, but it matters not!<page>If there's something nasty inside a shell that must come out, we use great Yarnaby's Extricator! It's your only hope, bzzt!<page>...Hmmm, but to crack your stiff shell we'll first need some extra strength. The healing can be done, yes! But before that my mighty Extricator needs an upgrade!",
  "SHOP_ITEM_SHARD_POUCH": "Travellers should always keep spare shards close by. We Bellharters were once renown for our fine claw-work. An art lost on most modern pilgrims... excepting yourself I'm sure.",
  "BELLHERMIT_SAVED_3": "What a persistent little worm you are. Amuse me then. Why did you cut those poor bugs from their comforting curse?<hpage>There was old power in the creature that guided the thread, and a talent of Silk, now taken, that shall prove useful to me.<hpage>That the town is freed and its service returned is a benefit too. I may ofttimes feel myself apart from these bugs, but even I recoil to see Silk strung in such sickening service.<page>Grnk. To free them was no favour. But the gathering of power... In that goal, we may understand each other some.",
  "RELIC_DEALER_RELICS": "Ahh... I smell something on you. Heavy with the past, you are. You have a relic for me, don't you?",
  "PINSMITH_QUEST_OFFER": "<hpage>Your skills are impressive. My needle sings from your care. But I must ask, can the blade be honed further?<page>You seek further sharpening? Further than Plinney does provide? Impertinence! But... Maybe? But... No...<hpage>You hesitate? Then it is possible? Are you incapable? Should I seek others within the kingdom?<page>Wait! Yes. Seek not others, but an oil, fabled and fine. With it the Citadel once brought gleaming edge and point to its pins.<page>Though the Citadel's pinmasters are long past, some small store of that miraculous elixir may remain within its halls.<page>Were even a meagre drop pilfered, and gifted upon Plinney, your blade could shine brighter still...<page>Just know, dear friend, the veiled bugs would be oh so unkind to the thief who'd claim that fine prize for themself.",
  "SHOP_ITEM_TOOL_POUCH_DESC": "You've a tool pouch on you? I can add a few pockets so you can carry more tools, and more shards to make'em. My sewing skills are quite renowned in these parts.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_MEET": "<page=S>Miss saving! We are together, at last! My brother and myself, both returned to safety's safe.<hpage>I am pleased you have found one another. If you are planning to venture out again, I would urge you reconsider for the sake of your shells.<page=S>We know it! Muchly-much! We cannot be leaving this home of bells. No more! Heres we will remain, for shells to survive. <page=T>But we instead did plan, together, clever! Yes-yes. Those pilgrims, them that pass, maybes they will help? For small reward as we have?<page=T>Even you, miss saving! Yes-yes! Saving is done. Our wishes now we ask. Now is time for miss courier!",
  "PINSMITH_QUEST_REOFFER": "Lost within that fortress above, the fabled oil of my profession... Such sharpness one could achieve...<page>But, oh! &#8216;Tis an awful thing. Too cruel, the many stabbing pins you'd face in its seeking.",
  "SHOPKEEP_PAINT_POST": "We've made a good start on the painting, resident! Give us a little more time and your bell'll be shining like new.",
  "BELLHERMIT_SNARE": "Hnff... So the slave comes seeking?<page>I've heard it. Wishing on a world cut free, yes? Along with my nephew up there. Sounds he's sunk as simple as you.<hpage>Will you not provide your aid, bug? This trap he plans requires power, and I suspect you're hoarding more than most.<page>Oh no. I'll give it. Not in the hope you'll succeed... Bah! In that, there's slim chance. I give just to see that restless energy unleashed.<page>So much soul, found and formed. Generations of it, all going to waste. Better it's given a chance to blaze.",
  "DOCTOR_DOOR_INSPECT": "A locked bellhome.<br>Call out?",
  "DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE": "<hpage>Madam, my shell has been overcome by a foreign force. Plasmium it has been called in your land.<hpage>Though the substance provides some regenerative aid, I feel my mind at dangerous risk of being overtaken.<page>Bzzt! Maybe overtaken is good? Better even? Why go thinking yours is a mind so precious?<page>The great Yarnaby treats the sick! Not those that benefit from their afflictions. Enjoy its advantage and leave me in peace!",
  "COURIER_SHORT_MEET": "Miss Saving! Thanks again for you and your big-big blade! I'm is made it back, and grumpy grub-grub got her goods. She seemed happy, even!<page>I'm won't be travelling out for a while-while methinks. Too many beasties! All about theys are. Even those pilgrims! All now going angry, a bit like old grub-grub.<hpage>This town remains safe for the moment, Tipp. You're a smart bug to stay within its walls.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_1": "<page=S>Keep safe, miss courier! You and your deliverings, fragile both can be!",
  "COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_3": "<page=T>Do not wait, miss courier! You hold the deliverings, so nows you must away! A quick-quick bug, you must become yourself.",
  "COURIER_SHORT_GOURMAND_HINT": "<hpage>Tipp, I have promised a wish to an old bug of the Citadel, ingredients for a dish to stir a gourmand's stomach.<hpage>Do you hold in your belongings a Courier's Rasher? It seems a key element.<page>Courier's Rasher! Not me, miss savings! Smelly, fatty foods, good for most. Not good for my sensitive stomach!<page>You want-want my brother, Pill! Pill is big. Pill loves rashers! Can prepare them fresh for you, but first, Pill must be found, saved, safe-safe!",
  "DOCTOR_CLOSED_QUEST_END": "Bzzt! What now?! Not another bother for the great Yarnaby?<hpage>Madam, I have returned with the spines requested. Allow me to enter, that you may remove this parasite from my shell.",
  "PINSMITH_UPGRADE_PROMPT": "Sharpen Needle?",
  "PINSMITH_UPGRADED_COMPLETE": "That blade! By claw! My finest work by far. Pharloom may ail, but across its morbid dim, your needle will shine bright. ",
  "SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_SPA_DESC": "Care to refresh yourself in a steaming spa? Given your hard labours, I'm sure your shell would thank you for it.",
  "SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_LIGHTS_DESC": "Twine strung globes filled with gleamflies. These'll brighten up even the darkest bell.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_DUSTPENSSLAVE_RETRY": "<page=S>Another egg. Another grossy eater queen. Delivery for the big-big creature beyond the roaches. Maybe this one travels safer than last?",
  "DOCTOR_SLAP_PRE": "Specimen, we must! There are secrets to uncover, bzzt! Progress can not be denied!",
  "COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_REPEAT": "<page=T>With your shell all a'wriggle, you can't be taking no deliverings! Infect the goods you would!<hpage>Very well, couriers. If I somehow manage to remove the parasite, I may return to offer aid.",
  "DOCTOR_CURSE_ACCEPT": "Bzzt! Bravo! A specimen who sees my brilliance!<page>The task for you is simple. Head over into that tangled mess of cages, on the roads above the moors.<page>Two bugs hide away there, Benjin and Crull. Simple types, woefully ignorant... yet they have been useful in procuring me materials.<page>It's Steel Spines I need. A full bundle of them, forged hard and sharp. Tougher than I've ever had. Tough enough to crack stone! And to pierce your thick shell, bzzt!<hpage>Then prepare your machine for my return, madam. I shall soon return with the spines, for I am eager to see myself freed.",
  "SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_DESK_NAME": "Desk",
  "PINSMITH_QUEST_ACCEPT": "<hpage>I will find the oil, pinmaster. My needle has seen much use in this cruel kingdom, and I suspect many more battles are due. I will value your further skills upon my blade. <page>It is a dangerous wish you accept of this poor pinmaster. I welly hope this one's professional desire does not cost you your life.",
  "BELLHERMIT_CURSED_REPEAT": "If you insist on surviving your infestation, seek the one exiled from Bellhart, little Yarnaby. She was chased out, high up into the moors, last I heard.",
  "RELIC_DEALER_GOT": "Yes... this fits my collection well. Look, then! Look at what I have!",
  "BELLHERMIT_REPEAT": "I'll waste no more words on a slave. Begone.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FIXER_RETRY": "<page=T>More deliverings for those sad survivors in their cave below. <page=S>Deliver them quick-quick, miss courier! They will help much.",
  "GREETER_TWISTED_BUD_HINT": "That cry upon you, sister! Those are the sour sobs of a grey and twisted thing.<hpage>You speak of the bud? It is a mysterious thing indeed. In the dank swamps above the moor, I sought towards its plaintive wails, and found it resting there... Waiting, it almost seemed.<hpage>But you speak of its form, without sighting it upon me. Is it a thing familiar to you?... Have you heard these cries before?<page>Aye, yes! Not your own specimen, surely, but way back, other travellers did sometimes carry similar. Odd types they all were. Offerings they'd call the crying things, and towards the core of Shellwood they would trek.<page>Never I did see one again, not the buds nor the bugs that brought the gift...<page>If you're planning to follow their path, I'll wish on your safety, but &#8216;tis an ill omen to hear such sad sounds returned after so long.",
  "RELIC_DEALER_MEET": "What? What, what? Who is it? What've you got? What do you want?<hpage>I am just a traveller, one hoping you were not too badly affected by the cursed snare set upon this town.<page>Pah! What binds them outside means nothing to me. None of them have my keen sense, my respect for the past!<page>You seem able, though. Sneaky, too. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I'll take it.",
  "PINSMITH_QUEST_COMPLETED": "And now! This pinmaster must work! Let the sharpening begin!",
  "BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1_ALT": "Hff. The noise from above has returned, that pitiful clamour. The threads have been cut.<page>You... It was you who cut them. Do not deny it!<hpage>Why should I deny it, sir? I defeated the cruel creature above the town, and awoke the old bell stilled by Silk. Are you displeased?<page>Displeased! If I breathe, if I live, I am displeased. Only the dead are satisfied.<page>You are a slave, and a nuisance... begone.",
  "GREETER_TALK1_ACT3": "Resident! What a marvel you are, continuing to dare the wilds and darkness, and returning home to us unscathed.<hpage>I return with hope worth sharing, Pavo. I have seen a way to calm this chaos, one I now work swiftly towards.<hpage>The chance remains slim, but if this town can hold, and my efforts succeed, Pharloom may see a future yet.",
  "SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_GRAMAPHONE_DESC": "The Citadel crafted some marvellous machines, and this looks to be one of its finest! Apparently sent by some creepy slitherer hidden away up there, for sale only to you! ",
  "RELIC_DEALER_EMPTY": "It's my calling it is, to gather the relics of the past. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I'll take it.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_NOTACCEPTED": "<hpage>I can not aid you, couriers. Not now. My own tasks are too pressing to consider taking on your deliveries. <hpage>With luck, some pilgrims may pass with sound mind and strength remaining. They may choose to promise your wishes.<page=T>Then we shall pray they come, miss saving! Our thanks go muchly with you, still.",
  "BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1": "Hff. The noise from above has returned, that pitiful clamour. The threads have been cut.<page>You... It was you who cut them down. Do not deny it!<hpage>Why should I deny it, sir? I severed the thread and defeated the creature guiding the curse unto the town. Are you displeased?<page>Displeased! If I breathe, if I live, I am displeased. Only the dead are satisfied.<page>You are a slave, and a nuisance... begone.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FLEATOPIA": "<page=T>We's heard the word! Many fleas together, settled high in Pharloom, calling out their wants of us!<page=T>Clever grubbers, fleas, but theys too need-need our deliverings. See them served, miss courier! Always goodly-good to gain the thanks of fleas.",
  "SHOPKEEP_MEET_ALT": "<hpage>Greetings, shopkeeper. I'd ask to trade, but your store seems a little bare.<page>Ahem! Well, yes. Our little town's seen some dire times, and now my courier's gone and got themself lost.<page>But don't worry! I've a few small things, still! And if that courier ever makes it safely back, we'll have plenty more treasures to haggle over.",
  "DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE_REPEAT": "Bzzt! Leave me in peace! The great Yarnaby treats the sick! Not those that benefit from their afflictions. Enjoy its advantage and leave me in peace!<hpage>Very well, madam. I did not mean to waste your time.",
  "PINSMITH_UPGRADE_FINISHED": "Bonva! It is done, brave warrior. By my expert claw, your strange blade has received some fast-sharp shine. It shall cut cleaner than ever before.<hpage>Your efforts provide great aid, pinmaster. You have my thanks.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_MEET_ACT3": "<page=T>Miss courier! What horror here! The caves shake-shake, crying pain of hurt most savage.<page=T>And see all our poor friends below, newly found, crowded inside this home of bells, hearts fast for fear.<page=S>But what-what for you? You are here to help, yes-yes? The deliverings, they are needed now at most! When caves turn dark, the deliverings are essential, more than more.",
  "COURIER_SHOP_BROKEN": "<page=T>The deliverings! They are broken-broke! Gone and spilled!<page=T>Do not lose hearty-heart, miss courier! This is Pharloom! Danger, deadly. In times as these, is a rarer thing for goods to get to their goings.<page=S>Would you try-try again? For the bugs so much in need of their deliverings?",
  "BELLHERMIT_SAVED_2": "Those bugs, cowering in their gleaming bells. Grnk. They claim a common calling, to serve the pilgrims as they make their path upwards.<page>Such a crucial role they award themselves, surely worthy of praise!<page>A sweet lie, of course. They, like their predecessors, are simply too weak and fearful to venture any farther. A settlement born from indolence.",
  "SHOPKEEP_MEET_ACCEPTEDWISH": "<hpage>He would have been wise to do so. If, on my travels, I happen upon the errant bug, I'll make sure to send him your way.",
  "PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_MEET_OFFER": "By claw! Are you then our saviour in the shell? Standing so calm and cool on entrance to Plinney's bellhome!<hpage>What clue, sir, tells of my part in your town's liberation?<page>Why your blade, fierce warrior! Any fine pinmaster would detect the sign of deadly work upon that needle's edge.<page>T'was a vile curse that struck here. No simple bug, nor basic pin could have granted our release. No!<page>That blade though, so expertly clutched in claw. That could welly have met the task. It was you who cut us free, yes?<hpage>I'll grant you've sharp sight, pinmaster, and your saving is fortuitous. This blade that restored your town would now benefit from your service.<page>Welly, yes! I've a busy backlog of pins to tend, but your gracious heroism decrees that unique weapon receives my care this very moment! What's say I take a look?",
  "RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW": "More, then! Bring me more relics of the past! Records, seals, idols! Let's gather up the history of the world and hoard it all here, nice and safe!",
  "COURIER_SHOP_REPEAT": "<page=S>Many deliverings still need making, miss courier! We is much needing your help, when you is ready for the giving of it-it!",

Although... your store now seems quite bare.<page>Ahem. Yes. I'll admit, the wait was longer than I'd anticipated, and a bug has to eat...<page>I'll have more to offer you once my courier turns up.

This pit of bells and the structure around it... they suggest a station for travel, though one long abandoned.<page>Aye. Rumours in the camp say these bells run throughout the lands, great veins of them, forged by our ancient kin.<page>And some even say bugs used to travel through them, in gilded carriages no less!<page>Surely such fanciful travel would be a sin for us pilgrims.

  "BB_RESIDENT_BELLHART": "Your travels have taken you far, haven't they? While I'm yet to even start my journey. Shameful behaviour for a pilgrim really, to tarry here so long.<hpage>I see no shame in it, sir. Your life is your own, and need not be squandered at the ghostly call of the Citadel. Journey out for your own sake, or not at all.<page>Heh... you truly aren't a pilgrim, that's for certain. That's blasphemy, spoken with friendly intentions or not.<page>And yet...

Are you a pilgrim, or just a wanderer?<hpage>I am no pilgrim, sir, though I have travelled their paths.<page>Not a pilgrim? Well, it makes no difference, I suppose.

That's just the nature of the journey, I suppose.<page>But I've seen so much! Great metal structures and vast scorched fields! The grandeur of it all is humbling indeed, even for one like me who was so humble to begin with.<page>I'll rest here just a little longer before resuming my climb.",

I was worried your battle with that enormous beast had left you badly wounded.<page>Shames me to have left you in danger there, missy, but I'm no warrior, and my tools ain't no match for a creature like that.<hpage>It is well that you kept yourself safe.

If the veiled bugs would go to such lengths to bring me here, I intend to find out why.<page>Oho! Ferocious! Intimidating! Yours is no pilgrim's spirit! You've the bearing of a hunter.<page>Welcome then, fierce traveller, to Pharloom! Our holy yet haunted land.<page>Before you depart, permit an old bug a brief warning. Best keep that weapon drawn.<page>Our kingdom is gripped by a curse.

  "BB_FIXER_Q1_COMPLETE": "Well, look at that! You've gone and donated all those shell shards, just like I wished for! I can scarcely believe it!<page>Those shards are valuable, alright. Brilliant for crafting and fixing, very versatile.<page>More than that, though... it was a warm thing you did, the sort of kindness you don't see much in this weary place.<hpage>Was this kindness? I must take care to learn of this land and claim what advantage I can from it. Answering requests like yours can often fit those ends.<page>Oh, it's like that, is it? Well, even still, the help's well appreciated, miss. Best of luck in your travels, and may every wish of yours be granted!",

Pharloom's already in the snare of one fell curse, we can't have another vying to leech what life remains.<page>Best you head quick over to that town of bells, at the core of our kingdom. I've an uncle hidden about there, an old hermit, and a horrid curmudgeon.<page>That hermit's a hard one to befriend, but he holds some knowledge about this kingdom's maladies.

All to reach that eternal, shining Citadel.<page>Once I'm good and ready, I'll make the climb myself...",
  "MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_C": "Mmm. Mmm! The pain... my mind aches. Why? The berries, the nasty fruits. Oh the visions!<page>You, wish promiser. Wish granter. You brought me what I needed and stayed by my side. Companion through my ordeal. I could ask for nothing more.",
  "MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_B": "Ahhh! Ahhh-ohhhh! The smell is right! Like the others! But very young! Oh, voice of the woods! Oh, dance of the queen! Oh... oh! Beat harder, let us hear it! Oh! Ohhhhhhhh!",
  "FUNERAL_2b": "Sing, brothers and sisters! Sing, and drown out this burdensome sorrow! Sing out the name of this poor pilgrim, whose journey had nary begun! ",
  "BELLWAY_PILGRIM_TALK_1": "Have you heard the talk of what waits just beyond this camp?<page>Brittle caverns of bone, the very base of Pharloom, filled with all manner of deadly creatures and jagged dangers.<page>It's said ancient bugs once made their homes amidst it.<page>Who could believe! In such a hostile, unstable place! In all my time, I've never met a bug so brave.",
  "BB_PILGRIM_HORNED": "Sister, sister! What is that long, gleaming tooth you carry with you? Is it a weapon?<hpage>It is indeed, though you need not fear. I will not raise it against you. Its edge is meant for predators and other foes.<hpage>I strongly suggest you arm yourself similarly before your own journey begins.<page>Alas... for a pilgrim, that's sin you speak of, sister.<page>We arm ourselves with prayer, garb ourselves in faith, and hope they prove enough to reach the Citadel's glory. Such is our way...",
  "BB_FIXER_Q1_INTRO": "Oh! Back again? The wishwall is up! Ready for all the poor souls who've been left behind down here.<page>In Pharloom, wishes are granted to those truly devout, or so they say. And there ain't no harm in us dregs having wishes too.<page>Why, I even went and added a little wish of my own to the wishwall! Fair's fair. I did build the thing. Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else's.",
  "BB_FIXER_MEET": "<hpage>What's this you're building, sir? A sign of some kind?<page>Aye, aye. You're a sharp bug! A wishwall. It's past time this old camp had one. As the resident fixer, I've taken it upon myself to sort it out.<page>They're a popular thing about Pharloom, wishwalls. Useful too. So many prayers left unanswered. Gives &#8216;em a place to go.",
  "BB_PILGRIM_ROUND_REPEAT": "I must listen carefully... and pray with uninterrupted devotion. Only then will my faith be strong enough... to carry me upward...",
  "BB_CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT": "S'not a surprise it's you rallying us to action, hunter. You had the sense about you, a bug bringing change'n all.<page>Course you're more than just a bug, aint'cha! More than Weaver. Guess it'd take someone like you for my family to dare hope at success.<page>Go and prove our trust now, won't you? We've spent our lifetimes wishing for another path. With a bit of luck, you might grant it.",
  "FUNERAL_NONAME": "Well. Though this pilgrim's name has been lost, still we sing.",
  "BB_RESIDENT_GOT_SPRINT": "Been hearing awful whispers in camp, about pilgrims driven mad by the hardships of the climb, crying out and attacking their fellows.<page>You've been out there. Tell me, is it really so?<hpage>You've heard it true, sir. On the roads, both pilgrims and beasts alike are consumed, driven to violence by a haunted thread, the source of which I have yet to discover.<page>Ah... I'd feared it was so. I won't be able to trust a single face out on the path, then.<page>The risk of death was daunting enough, but the loneliness of such a journey, that seems almost too much to bear... Ah well. Just another test of our devotion, I suppose.",
  "BB_PILGRIM_HORNED_REPEAT": "We pilgrims arm ourselves with prayer, garb ourselves in faith, and hope they prove enough to reach the Citadel's glory. Such is our way...",
  "BB_CARETAKER_TALK_03": "<hpage>What duty binds you to this old chapel, madam? The structure barely stands, and I see no signs of congregation.<page>Aye! Gone! The lot'o them, fled and hidden. But I'm not leaving till I've set this place right...<page>...It's that Citadel above, you see. Even now, in Pharloom's long decline, the simple bugs, they're witless before it. Too grand. Too majestic. Too powerful.<page>This building's state is a sad example of those who'd dare suggest another path...",
  "BB_FIXER_ACT3_DELIVERY": "Eh? What fortune is this? Our wish answered, even in a moment so dark!<page>You've proved quite the saviour, miss, and you've certainly earned the appreciation of this whole sorry lot.<hpage>You are welcome, sir. For you few, I hope these supplies may aid.",
  "BB_PILGRIM_ROUND": "You, in the cloak... pray tread softly. I am meditating, gathering my faith... before my pilgrimage begins.<hpage>My steps are soft enough, madam. If I have disturbed you, it was not my intent.<page>Ahh... even your speech... far too loud. I can scarcely hear my thoughts. Please, be away...",
  "BB_CARETAKER_BONEGRAVE": "I see you've gone and opened up the great bone gate back there. And without even asking my permission! Feeling curious, were you?<hpage>There is a vast grave beyond. I'd assumed most bugs died climbing the path, but it seems many fell before their trek had barely commenced?<page>Aye! Lost their lives to beasts, or to luck turned rotten. Others were simply formed too frail.<page>At least those poor souls can rest together. Death and death and death, the eternal promise of our eternal kingdom. Eventually it claims us all. ",
  "BB_CARETAKER_BASEMENT_TALK_01": "Hunter! I'm thinking it was you that cleared my basement?<hpage>On first arrival here, the nesting creatures didn't take kindly to my passing.<page>Ohho. They're cranky bugs, alright. And they made an awful mess down here with their hatching and breeding.<page>You've my many thanks for seeing them off!",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_DECLINE_QUEST1": "Ah... I understand, stranger. I presume too much of one who is not a flea.<page>I've heard the settlement below us is setting up a wishwall. Perhaps I'll send Grishkin down to hang up our wish...<page>",
  "TROUPE_HUNTER_EMPTY": "Bug not flea, my learnings, all have been scratched to your maps. Can give no more.<page>Leave now! Seek and save lost fleas, for a caravan full and whole!",

It gladdens me that so strong a flea exists as her.<hpage>Yours was a caravan sorely lacking for protection, and I am too bound by my own tasks to provide it for you.<page>Why, we would never impose so! And now, no matter! Her scent may be strong, and her taste for brew bottomless, but her skill is sharp.<page>If predators draw close, her talents will provide much confidence to our caravan.",
  "TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_NOMAP_ACT3": "You remain, bug not flea? Would you seek service of me, ehh? Mine is knowledge much, the places of the lost little ones, heard and smelt across the caves.<page>You could help find! And bring! For all to come together now that times turn dark...<page>But no map you hold! If learnings are wanted, a map must be owned. Until then, we have no trade to make.",

Heh heh!<page>The Fleamaster, that old bore, tells me to call you Miss Hornet. But such a prickly name ill befits such a delicate beauty! Shall I call you something prettier, like &#8216;Nectarsweet', my dear?<hpage>You shall not. Address me by my name or not at all.<page>Gradak! Of course. Of course! Heh heh. And now, I shall let you in on my little secret. My carriage doubles as a soothing spa, you see. It's most ingenious.<page>The water inside is piping hot, and purer than a psalm! Heh heh! I'd gladly let you soak inside, for a modest fee!",
  "FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_FIRST": "Dear one, how shameful for the world to end while poor Kratt still has so much living left in him!<page>But how sweet of you to join me here! Will you play the Flea Bounce game, that I may appreciate the beauty of your agile form while I await my doom?<page>To play is simple. Leap up and keep bouncing on the fleas who fly past for as long as you are able!",

They must all be hiding or stuck in dangerous places, but if you rouse them they are sure to find their way here to us.<page>May the kingdom bless your travels and keep you safe, stranger! You are welcome to rest here with us whenever the roads bring you back!",

I'm told it's good luck to bring a guest along when travelling, so we must have you to thank!<page>I trust the trip was agreeable for you. A pleasure perhaps? Nestled in with our dear little ones...<hpage>They certainly make for energetic travel companions. I've not often had opportunity to socialise with such spirited sorts.<page>Splendid! And now, you must go and see Grishkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron. After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits!",
  "TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_BREW_FULL": "Miss Hornet, your bottle is full of Flea Brew. You know what such means! You must have drink! Har har!<page>When you have finish drinking, return and we will fill flask again! I'm is always brewing!",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_REWARD": "Ahh, and before the road steals you away from us again, allow me to offer you a humble gift!<page>One of the little ones found a pale artefact while digging about in the sands. A spiny, cold sort of thing.<page>I see no use in it for we fleas, so of course we are all too pleased, eager even, to bestow it upon our dear friend!",

I'm worry for the little flea's health in this land.<page>And they make play in the filthy water. I say them stop, but they just laugh and splash on me. They are lack respect!<hpage>Most bugs instinctively obey those with strength and will. Speak with authority, or your commands may go unheeded.<page>Ugh... really, is Fleamaster's job to teach the fleas such. I will just have rest here until is time to move on.",

This beautiful spot you've gifted us, safe apart from the dark and death of the lands beside. A place for fleas to grow smart and strong.<page>Here we shall see our travels end, for in Pharloom there could be no finer place to settle.<hpage>I am glad the location suits, Fleamaster. It is a calming thing to know these many fleas may survive. Most bugs of Pharloom seem destined for far bleaker fates.<page>Indeed! A hopeful future awaits! And only because of yourself and your efforts. To commemorate our arrival, it would be my pleasure to perform a small service for you.<page>\rI have been learning to sew, and the little fleas have been gathering materials for me. I thought I could add an extra pocket to your tool pouch, to make your travels just a little easier.<page>\rA trifling favour, much less than you deserve, but still I hope it meets to your satisfaction!",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_JUDGE_TRAVELED": "Another journey complete! And a new, high spot for our rest, upon the doorstep of that mighty Citadel, no less!<hpage>It is fortunate that all of your companions survived the trek, Fleamaster. The howling rise beside, and the tangled wood before it, have both claimed the lives of countless bugs.<page>Indeed! A perilous ascent! Maybe it was your company that brought us luck, Miss Hornet? It surely put us fleas at ease to have you and your weapon riding close.",

Have no fear, my friend, we fleas are but humble travellers!<hpage>Well met sir, though like you I am not of these lands. I am merely journeying through.<page>Oh. Oho! A kindred spirit!

This gilded chamber can barely contain us all!<page>The many fleas are itching to journey once more, to find a space to stretch their wings. But from here, as their leader, I am hesitant to order us so swiftly away.<page>These heights hold too much danger to set forth without a safe goal held clear in mind.<page>What of you, Miss Hornet? Your tasks carry you throughout this kingdom. Have you ever encountered a place appropriate?",

Stranger, could you not help us?",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_CANLEAVE": "<hpage>Fleamaster, if your troupe is still prepared to travel, I have discovered a cave beyond the Citadel, at the edge of some ancient aqueducts.

I had no intent to intrude! And I barely saw a thing!<hpage>Lie no more to me, flea, and be grateful you still live. Know that if you peer again, you will die.<page>Of course! Kratt would never!

Of your many companions, I had little worry you would survive to find this caravan.<hpage>Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?<page>Grrr....Mine is to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together and grow them strong.<hpage>If you have sensed the locations of other lost fleas, would you share them with me?

Nor would I contest your right to this cave. I only ask what task causes you to perch alone atop these dank ducts?<page>Task? Mine is a work most important, but not for talking of here, where danger waits close. Soon, I depart, to seek fleas, my fellows, and join them.<page>Now... Grrr. You leave me!

An impossible number, yet here they are, safely joined together. Our most cherished wishes answered!<hpage>If you were seeking fleas to join your caravan, I have found and freed many throughout my travels.<page>Oh! Can it be? Then you here are our saviour, our dear fleafriend! For all have made their way right, straight to us!<page>And now, with our caravan full to bursting, we've rested long enough.

Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan. These are dangerous lands to travel alone.<page>Oh, vavenda! That is to say, incredible! What a beautiful thing it is! All of us together.<page>Dear friend... Miss Hornet. Our caravan prepares to depart toward the wide moor high above. Would you travel with us, as our honoured guest?",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_INFO_LECH": "A strange flea has joined our troupe. All are welcome, but something about this one sets my fur to raise.<page>His carriage offers a steaming service, but the charge in rosaries is stiff, especially for us fleas who carry few.<page>For the companionship we provide, and the safety of our numbers, surely some discount is deserved?",
  "FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE": "Vikna! Dear one, you outdo yourself! To beat your previous high score is a marvel indeed!",

While the world crumbles around us, we will laugh and dance and frolick!<page>Make merry with us, and play some of the games of old!<hpage>My time is slim, Fleamaster. If I am to join your games, know it will be only to hone my skills for the greater trial I must soon face below.<page>Of course! Of course! Joy or learnings! Any reason is fine by us, Miss Hornet!<page>And look here, we have Flea Juggle, where the challenge is to strike fleas upwards and keep them airborne for as long as possible.<page>To have our treasured guest challenge this humble game would be an honour for us, truly!",

Amongst all of your troupe, I had little doubt you would survive to reach this caravan.<hpage>Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?<page>Grrr....Bug not flea! Mine is to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together and grow them strong.<hpage>If you have sensed the locations of other lost fleas, share them with me. I may be able to send them safe to the caravan.<page>My learnings? Not free for you, bug not flea. Rosaries! Give those and I shall say of what I have sensed. Work like mine... much long, and hard. For that, I deserve some riches held.",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ALLRESCUED_ACT3": "We fleas are all gathered, but now the world has loudly marked its ending! As great as our numbers grew, it seems our caravan will be the last.<page>There is only one thing left to do... but the preparations require time. If your travels wind their way back to us, dear friend, you yourself are welcome to participate...",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_FLEATOPIA_HUNTER_HINT": "Miss Hornet, I must tell, we've seen evidence nearby of a hunter of our tribe, a flea that seeks fleas!<page>As pungent and gruff as their sort often are, they're still useful to have around a caravan.<page>A flea of their rare skill, settled among us, could offer defence and more.<page>If you're still to be helping grow our town, search them out, up atop the muck choked ducts.",

  "TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE": "<hpage>Fair greetings again, large flea. Of your many companions, I had little worry you would survive safe to find this caravan.<hpage>Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?<page>Grrr....Mine was to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together so strong they could grow.<page>A task once important, mine! But not now. All fleas are here, safe. A rare many! Time for toasts, and brew to fill our bellies!",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_CANLEAVE": "Look here! All these lively fleas flocked to our caravan. Thanks to you and your hunting, our numbers grow grand. Mayhap, in time, we could grow to match even those caravans of our fabled past?<hpage>To see so many safe is a welcome sight, Fleamaster. Their playful cheer suggests you are a fine steward for the swelling troupe.<page>Such kind words, Miss Hornet! How lucky we are to have found a friend so fair!<page>But now, we must away! These moors have been our host long enough. It is time to climb and hoist towards drier caves!<page>Good friend to fleas, would you join us on this next journey? ",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_MEET": "Ahh, Miss Hornet! Greetings, and well met, once again!<page>The journey here was long, but we didn't lose a single flea! And now fate has brought us back together again... what a marvel!<hpage>It is good to see you safe, Fleamaster. The journey to this moor from the caverns below is long and dangerous.<page>Dangerous, certainly, but we fleas are born to roam!<page>And now, you must go and see Grishkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron. After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits!",
  "TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_MEET": "Grrr.. bug not flea. Why you must bother me? This spot is mine, fair fought and earned.<hpage>I won't stay long, madam. Nor would I contest your right to this cave.<hpage>I have encountered several of your fellows fleas, united in a caravan. Perhaps you would consider joining with them?<hpage>Yours seems a hardy hide, and I fear alone they lack the strength to survive long in this land.<page>Caravan? Grrr. Felt it in my fur... Time for change. If caravan is close, then my task, these lands, may near be complete.<page>Now... Grrr. Much talk I gave. You leave me! Meet again at caravan, amongst good fellows. There I share my learnings of fleas and Pharloom. Till then, rest I need! Off, bug!",

  "FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED_CHAMP": "Vikna! The game is ended, and we have a new Flea Juggle champion! Incredible!<page>Miss Hornet, with your skill I'm certain you could best all three of our games and become the grandest champion of them all!",
  "CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED_ACT3": "My, what a sweet face now emerges from the darkness! Poor Kratt has been hiding here from those blackened beasts for too long, all alone!<hpage>The beasts and bugs ensnared by the black thread are dangerous indeed. You have done right to hide yourself from them, sir.<hpage>That metal carriage... It is yours, I assume?<page>Ooh, yes, yes! I'm setting out to join the nearest flea caravan, aren't I? Safety in numbers, yes? I've had more than enough of venturing alone.<page>And you... I trust I will see you there? My carriage hides a special secret I'd gladly share with you when next we meet! Heh heh!",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_QUEST1": "There are still many fleas for us to be united with though, and we've rested long enough. The caravan must head higher!<page>Oh but stranger, how remiss of me! I introduced myself earlier without ever asking for your own name. Forgive me! Please, what shall we call you?<hpage>You may call me Hornet, Fleamaster. Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan. These are dangerous lands to travel alone.<hpage>I still have a long journey ahead of me. If I come across any more fleas, I will assist where I am able.<page>Oh, vavenda! That is to say, incredible! What a beautiful thing for me to hear!<page>Dear friend... Miss Hornet. Our caravan must be away now, toward the wide moor high above. Would you travel with us, as our honoured guest?",
  "TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA": "So many awful places have us fleas travelled. Many times I almost die. But here is seems safe enough.<page>You will have rest too? Is space enough for us all now... friend.",
  "TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_JUDGE": "Welcome again, Miss Hornet! See how high our caravan has climbed, resting right on the doorstep of that mighty Citadel!<hpage>It is fortunate that all of your companions survive the trek, Fleamaster. The howling rise beside, and the tangled wood before it, have both claimed the lives of countless bugs.<page>Indeed! A perilous ascent! We have seen the many husks in passing. A mighty luck must shine on us, to journey with such success.",

  "TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_FLEATOPIA_TRAVELED": "What a beautiful spot you've gifted us, Miss Hornet! Safe apart from the dark and death of the lands beside. A place for fleas to grow smart and strong.<page>Here we shall see our travels end, for in Pharloom there could be no finer place to settle.<hpage>I am glad the location suits, Fleamaster. It is a calming thing to know these many fleas may survive. Most bugs of Pharloom seem destined for far bleaker fates.<page>Indeed! A hopeful future awaits! And only because of yourself and your efforts. To commemorate our arrival, it would be my pleasure to perform a small service for you.<page>I have been learning to sew, and the little fleas have been gathering materials for me. I thought I could add an extra pocket to your tool pouch, to make your travels just a little easier.<page>A trifling favour, much less than you deserve, but still I hope it meets to your satisfaction!",

How good of you to speak words of hope for our benefit, but we have accepted our fate. Come, let us forget the past and revel together!<hpage>It is not merely hope that I offer you sir, but a promise.

You speak... with such conviction. But I cannot bring myself to hope such, I am sorry.<page>Come what may, we fleas will be here until the end. And the games will continue, of course!

  "PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_SIT_TALK_01": "<hpage>Pinstress, why do you choose to live amidst these storm-swept caverns? Surely there are more hospitable places?<page>Somewhere gentler? Warmer? I'd only go soft! How else is one expected to maintain their wits?<hpage>Then this is not a place of hiding? That Citadel up top seems no friend to the free, or the strong who'd choose to remain apart.<page>...Aye. Well, yes. That too's a reason, though one that shames me some.<page>Our grand Citadel learnt well from the training of Pinstresses past. Then it went and turned those teaching upon us!<page>Despite our superior skills, our numbers have always been few and their strength overwhelmed.<page>Of my once revered order, only two of us remain, wormed away in Pharloom's forgotten corners, and my pin-sibling, she's lost herself to more peaceable pursuits.",

  "PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_STAND_REPEAT": "Even my welcome has limits, needle bug.<page>I've become well accustomed to solitude, and it's unnerving to play host to your strange strength overlong.",
  "PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REOFFER": "Planning to hang about are you, needle bug?<page>Fancy a little training? Care to test the power of a Pinstress? Might be even this old master could show you a thing or two?",
  "PINSTRESS_FINAL_REOFFER": "Having second thoughts on our bout, needle bug? Good! I'll not hold back my blade, and I'll expect the same from you.",
  "STEEL_SENTINEL_MEET": "...Bug... Higher... It has come seeking... Zi is found... She is awoken.<hpage>Greetings, child of steel. I have known your type, in past. From your presence it is clear this land too has caught the long gaze of your Masters.<page>Masters... Yes... For them, Zi observes... obedient... always...<page>And you... a creature in half... Pale It... Bug It... old... stubborn... alone... You too are observed.",
  "STEEL_SENTINEL_OFFER_NO_MAP": "...Creature, higher... Its meeting, Zi's awakening... It is not chance... It has been sent, by Masters served?...

Zi sensed clear your meeting... The rite... The vassal is tarnished. They have touched the dark. By the Masters they will now be hunted... no matter the distance fled.<hpage>Perhaps, for your vassal, that is preferable? Waste here in servitude or flee free. They made their choice, and proclaimed it clear by their black action.<hpage>Their dark champion is slain, but luck or guile may yet see them survive.<page>Hope!.. Pale It... For a vassal who defies the Masters?... You give Zi a thought, complex...<page>The outcome is different... and Zi must now observe alone... but this may be the better way?<page>Zi shall accept the happening... shall pray the Masters still see her loyal... and Zi too will share the hope... that her vassal lives long unbound.",

  "WORLD_EDGE_ACT3_REPEAT": "<hpage>I will not flee. I cannot abandon the kingdom to a collapse of my making.",
  "STEEL_SENTINEL_REOFFER_NO_MAP": "Creature, higher... return when a chart is acquired. A chart is needed, essential, to serve the Masters... to aid Zi.",
  "PINSTRESS_FINAL_DECLINE": "Ahh... Shame. Surely battle'd be the better end, no?<page>If not by blade, we'll just have to accept whatever conclusion this new quaking calamity flings upon our heads.",
  "STEEL_SERVANT_RITUAL": "<hpage>Cease your summoning, fool bug!<hpage>Though you may yearn for freedom, that saviour you hope to call will bring only death.",
  "PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_TALK": "It's a right long time since I've felt so vigorous. All those dulled pilgrims are useless for testing my talents.<hpage>Your blade proved an impressive challenge, Pinstress. The strength and skills hidden about this kingdom continue to surprise me.<page>You bear your own strange strengths, needle bug. More I think than you'd be willing to reveal to me.<page>What, I wonder, are you planning to turn all that power towards?",
  "STEEL_SERVANT_END_1": "No. No. No... My champion slain!<page>Why do you do this, cruel slasher? Why must I stay, and serve, so long, long, long?<hpage>That void must not be called, bug. Not ever. None can control it, though many have tried. <hpage>Any strength you hoped it offered would fast be proven false.<hpage>Consider yourself fortunate I arrived in time. Your shell is saved, all by wish of your steel companion, and fear of her Masters' punishment.",
  "WORLD_EDGE_ACT3": "<hpage>If I chose to head beyond I would abandon Pharloom to a collapse of my making.<hpage>While I live, and still possess the strength to act, I will not allow that end to come to pass.",
  "PINSTRESS_FINAL_ICECORE": "Dunno if you've heard it, needle bug, but supposedly there's a gleaming secret hidden at this mountain's core.<page>Meant to be a marvel, or so my sisters past once told, a giant cavern all of crystal.<page>If you're hanging around these heights, and time's allowing, maybe you'll get to seeking it?<page>Course you'd first have to find the entrance, but you've certainly shown the skills to wriggle up in there, provided you're so inclined.",
  "STEEL_SENTINEL_END_2": "<page>A small gift for you pale It... for the thought, complex... rock of the home spear... and of Zi's birth. May it aid your further action in this land.",
  "PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REPEAT": "Off with you now, needle bug! A Pinstress of my substantial talent requires their deep meditation, especially after such a satisfying bout.<hpage>Goodbye, Pinstress. May your blade remain sharp.",
  "BLUE_SCIENTIST_OFFER": "Oho? You linger here still? Perhaps, like myself, you have been bewitched by the Plasmium's beautiful glow?<page>Then join me, you must! A new assistant is needed. Together we shall unlock the secrets of this wondrous substance!",

  "BS_SIT_QUEST1_REPEAT": "Bring the Pure Plasmium. It must be tested... ingested.<page>Ready the Needle Phial to full charge... Strike deep the ripened buds. Return that precious liquid life to me... Assistant.",
  "BLUE_SCIENTIST_ACCEPT": "Excellent! With two bugs at the task, the rate of discovery shall greatly increase!<page>Now! Before he up and vanished, my previous assistant seeded the warrens below with Plasmium buds.<page>The buds should be ripening as we speak and the nectar within must be extracted before they reach maturity.<page>With the right tool in claw, collecting the nectar is an easy process. I'll even lend you my own Needle Phial for the job.<page>Once you locate a bud, simply charge the Phial until readied, then release its needle into a bud's core.

  "BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST_REPEAT": "Assistant! You're still dallying about here? I've an eager need for pure Plasmium, fresh from the bud.<page>Just one fully charged stab of my Needle Phial straight into a ripe bud!

I suspect it can even defy death itself!<hpage>Plasmium, you call it? I have encountered its like before, or else a substance of remarkable similarity...<page>Highly unlikely! The grey and barren soil of the mainland could never produce something as singular as this, and that is undisputable fact!<page>Plasmium was discovered by my master at the farthest edge of Pharloom, hidden deep in salt-stricken waters.

No ill effects have been observed, and so we can conclude that the process is utterly, completely safe.<page>Keep using the Plasmium Phial, and enjoy all the wonderful effects it has on your body.

I promised the wish of bugs concerned for your safety.<hpage>I urge you to head their way now, beside the old bell, up and over.<hpage>A small settlement has formed there, and the bell, reawakened, seems to ward away the worst of the Citadel's many dangers.<page>A settlement? In these long-haunted halls? Are you telling naughty little lies, dear one? Well, I suppose there's not too much danger in going and seeing the truth for meself.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_2": "Be away then, dear one, and leave me to gather up my trinkets and baubles.<page>If this settlement of yours truly has bugs settled safe, I'll be able to make some lucrative trades. Blessings and farewell!",

Ready to make your play, to oust one ruler and claim her place?<hpage>I'll not deny some part of me desires that outcome... Dominance, it seems, is baked deep in my blood, as too, no doubt, for the one up top.<hpage>And yet, another part resists... A part, over time, I find myself siding with more...<hpage>That part wishes not to claim a monarch's mantle, rather it would see my freedom regained, and this kingdom's bugs unshackled from their pale chains.<page>...Remarkable idea you're speakin' there, bellringer, a world cut free. Not a wish I've had much cause to hope on, serious like... but I ain't so surprised to hear you speak it.<page>For all your helpin', I been seein' it clearer. You've still got the monarch in you, alright, and the glare of a Weaver, but the ambition... that's wild different from both.<hpage>If you have already guessed to my desire, sir, and share some part of it, would you offer me aid in the conflict to come?<page>Aye... Maybe, yes. I can barely bear to tell it... But there's an idea, one rare discussed, for fear of her up there sensin' the score.<hpage>You have conceived a method, I take it? A way to see a monarch... removed? And me left free from claiming her station?<page>...We have, me and what remains of my family. S'a trap, of a sort, beyond the skill of this Citadel, one to go further than just her binding. You'd be just the hunter to set it, if you're dare enough to try...",
  "CARETAKER_SWAMP_SOUL": "What's that you got there, bellringer? Stole someone else's soul for yourself?<hpage>You speak of the remnant I found in the muck-choked caves beside the Citadel? This is soul siphoned from a once powerful bug.<hpage>It's only a thin mix now, but there is still some strength left. At peak, their talents must have been impressive.<page>Aye, they was that. I knew the bug, in &#8216;is prime, long time back. Braver'n most, and as little a fan of this Citadel as you yourself.<page>Went seekin' alliance with those basic bugs of the swamps. Thought they'd both gain from the union... Scheming defiance, or some such stupidity!<page>Now he's as dead as he was daft! Don't go tryin' ta make friends in Pharloom, bellringer.

From beyond the border of our lands?<hpage>You are correct. The one who waits atop this Citadel... Through their hospitality, I arrived in this kingdom. I seek now to return that welcome in kind.<page>Hmph. Beastly words, them. Finely spoken, but beastly all the same.<page>I just pray you don't bring any more unneeded pain down on the heads of these gormless little pilgrims...",

  "CARETAKER_MERCHANT": "Heard you did the savin' for our dear merchant there? I've seen her about, sneaking and scrounging, even a'fore you was ringing that bell.<page>She's a useful sort, but don't let her age be foolin', she's still the sharpest mind for a deal.<page>Won't be long till there's nary a rosary about this shrine that ain't found its way into her pockets.",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_REOFFER": "Bellringer... Re-thinkin' on that trap, are ya? It's a mad method, for sure, but you'd be just the hunter to set it, if'n you're dare enough to try...",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT": "<hpage>Grant me your aid, sir. If your trap provides a path to freedom, both for myself and your land's bugs, I may indeed choose to trigger it.<hpage>What work do you need of me now to see your service made?<page>It's my family's strength you'll need be seeking, bellringer, us three ol' bugs still alive, spread &#8216;cross this kingdom, and one poor cousin dead and drained in swamps choked rotten.<page>Each has power. Raw, savage stuff! For you, they'll give it, if for their fascination at the act, or the thrill of defiance... or because they have no choice at all.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_WARDKEY": "Real fine key this. No doubt it'll open the way to somewhere special. Somewhere full of goodies, I'll bet. Find the lock, and it'll practically pay for itself!",
  "CARETAKER_DELIVERY": "<hpage>Caretaker, I bring supplies from the town of bells below the Citadel.<page>And badly needed they are, miss bellringer. Ain't much finding or foraging happening with this mob, what with them choir types all stalkin' about the chambers beside.",

  "PILGRIM_SMALL_01": "So you found this place too, sister? This Citadel's grand promise has been strangled away by cursed thread, but at least the great bell here grants us some sanctuary.<page>We're amongst the blessed few... granted just a little more living.",

Just make sure you come back here soon, you lout! I ain't dealing with all the fresh intake myself!<hpage>If time permits, sir bug, I shall visit again. ",

  "CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT_SNARE": "For the last part, I'll also be needin' that rune setter you're carryin'. Clever old Weaver tool, that thing, and the perfect base on which to stretch our power.<page>Once you've collected for yourself the other critical parts, I'll ask you pass it over as well.",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_SWAMP": "Find the husk of my cousin, claimed by the scorned bugs of the swamps. A careless fool to let himself be taken, and dead they might be, but some glimmer of his soul can still be sensed.",

  "CITY_MERCHANT_MEET_AFTERBRIDGE": "T'was a good deed you did up above, dear one, saving me from them screeching flocks. Not seen the like of it in a long, long time.<page>I've returned with all sorts of new goodies, too. Lets see if anything I've scavenged will fit your fancy.",
  "CARETAKER_WISHES_PROGRESS": "Don't think I ain't see'in it, bellringer! A whole lotta helpin' you've been up to, both here and down below!<page>S'a strange mantle you're takin' for yourself, seeing all them bugs saved and wishes promised.<hpage>You find it strange, sir? I've found some solace in the service, and the rewards received have proved a boon on my journey.<page>Aye! But it ain't your place now, is it? I see well what you are, Weaver'n more! It's below your station! You ain't no common sort meant for carin' on us low folk.<hpage>I could say the same for you, who still chooses to remain cowled. You continue to pose as only a simple pilgrim. Don't you think it's past time you ceased the performance?<page>Leave off, Old One! Permit a bug their small disguise! It's been a pleasant thing to play simple. And I weren't calling for change, even if you seem insistent on bringing it!<hpage>Change was unavoidable, sir, whether I arrived or not. The monarch stirs. Its threads stretch far. My presence only accelerates the inevitable.<page>So what're you hopin' for, eh? Planning to usurp, to perch above us all as queen? Build up our hopes only to string us all in your own beastly web? Such is the way of Weavers and gods both...",
  "CARETAKER_LV3_MEET": "You keep at all that helpin', you're gonna start inspiring it in others! Best you think serious about what effect you might be causin', bellringer!<page>Too much hope could prove a dangerous thing, &#8216;specially for all these bugs starved so long of it.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_BRIDGE_2": "Now, why don't you hurry back to the shrine and let them all know what a good job you've done?<page>There might be a few more goodies to gather up on my way back, and I don't need you lingering around in the meantime. Blessings and farewell!",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SIMPLEKEY": "Simply forged, and simply styled. Designed to open all sorts of different locks, if they be basic enough.",
  "PILGRIM_STANDARD_MEET": "Sister, sister! Let me confide in you! As I ascended the Citadel's chambers to reach this place, I swear I heard the laughter of a child!<page>Wasn't much more than an echo, and I confess me fear's been playing awful tricks on me... and yet that voice still keeps ringing in my head.<page>Surely though, no bug so young and lively could survive within those heartless halls?",
  "PILGRIM_LARGE_SK_SAVED_ACT3_MEET": "Sister, you seen &#8216;em out there? Our new champion, that golden knight stalking the Citadel's crumbling halls?<page>Tall, righteous bug. Not much for conversing. Still! I'd be long dead if not for their appearance.<page>And I ain't the only one. Others have spoken of the knight's timely deeds and rare bravery.<page>We're desperate for any protection we can get, and that gleaming champion's been offering their aid almost as much as you yourself.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_REPEAT": "If you're going to keep skulkin' around here while I work, you may as well buy something. Take a look dear one, don't be shy!",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT_NO_SNARE": "And last, as the base, seek a weapon of Weavers past. Should still be one left, down there in their largest nest, a snare to set a rune'o searing Silk. Our own trap'll be woven tight about it.",
  "CARETAKER_MEET_3": "Admit it! You done it! You shifty li'l bell-runger!<hpage>You have chosen a curious place to rest, sir. Do you perhaps know something of this shrine and its companions in the lands below?<page>Oh, so you ask funny questions as well as cutting bells free, eh? You certainly ain't a pilgrim, but you're clearly not of the Choir either. No! I know exactly what you are...<page>A bell-ringing lout! A weirdo! Don't you realise what you've done, waking that shrine back up?<page>That bell has rung out far and wide! The wretched and the lost will have heard its call. They'll be making their way here now.<page>Well, what's done is done, and what's rung is rung. Just make sure you come back here soon, you lout! You can help me deal with all the dirty little pilgrims and desperate scavengers who turn up.",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_COMPLETE_PRE_CANCEL": "Oi! What's this? Suddenly havin' second thoughts? For sure its a frightful thing to attempt, but you've already put in all the leg work!<page>She up top'll already be sensin' your goal, vague-like maybe, but there ain't no worth to backin' out now.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SPOOLEXTEND": "Stretch a spool out nice and long with this fine-wrought tool. The perfect purchase if you're planning to hoard a lot of Silk for yourself!",
  "CARETAKER_WISHES_PROGRESS_REPEAT": "You keep at all that helpin', you're gonna start inspiring it in others! Best think serious about what effect you might be causin', bellringer!<page>Too much hope could prove a dangerous thing, &#8216;specially for all these bugs starved so long of it.",
  "PILGRIM_GENERIC_ACT3_MEET": "Ooohh... What new horror now besets us?<page>Is this fresh punishment for our sins, or yet another test to prove our faith?<hpage>It is neither, good bug. In this disaster you bear no blame.<hpage>Hold close to your companions and I will work swift to see this madness stilled.",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_SNARE": "For the base, we'll be needin' a weapon of Weavers past. Search down low, aside the paths of bone, inside their largest nest. S'a snare device, one to set a rune'o searing Silk.",
  "PILGRIM_STANDARD_REPEAT": "I swear I heard it, sister... That laugh! It almost sounded like they were enjoying themself...",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_NEEDOLIN_TOOL": "Hold this while makin' music and you'll soon hear its function. Amplifies song, it does! Sends it out full and bright. Ideal if you're ever planning on performing for a crowd.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_ROSARYSTRING": "How about we get your loose beads all strung up safe? I'll pinch a few for their braiding, but that's surely worth it for the peace of mind.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_GRAND_FORUM": "Ooh, I'm glad I wriggled my way over here! What a bounty's been laid out by our benefactors, those generous Conductors! Giants amongst bugs they are, all-seeing and kind!<page>It's beautiful here, and goodies are everywhere. Only enough for one though, dear one, so don't be greedy! You know I got here first. Blessings, and farewell! ",
  "PILGRIM_LARGE_MEET": "You stay close, sister. Them halls beside are crawling with haunted husks.<page>Wandering will only bring death, pointed and painful!",
  "CARETAKER_WARD": "Have you done it yet, bellringer? Wriggled deep? Discovered the depths of obsession that brought this place so low?<hpage>If you speak of this Citadel and its Silk, Caretaker, then yes, I now know the start of it. <hpage>In the ward down below, I saw it clear, the hollowed husks, and the many torturous implements... machines to instill a bug with thread, that would see their life extended.<page>Aye! That's it, in part! But there's more scale to it than all that. Just think of'em greedily shoving the Silk into their shells, the madness that overcame them, eternal life for mortal bugs! Then think on how long it's all gone on...<hpage>...The children born of them, and all the pilgrims after... The Silk has seeded deep into this kingdom's shells, generations deep...<hpage>No wonder Pharloom's bugs proved such easy prey for that haunted thread. It had only to seek for itself to reach them.<page>Ho ho! Now your seein' it, bellringer! These poor pilgrims, all born bound to the cruel system of our world, now stricken in its new cursed web.<page>You at least are free from it. And free to shake it all up... if'n that's your choosing.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_BRIDGE_1": "Well, well, if it isn't my very own shadow, the clever little red-cloak! You still following me around, trying to pinch away some of the goodies I sniff out?<hpage>You mistake my intent, ma'am, somewhat ungenerously. The pilgrims of the settlement below were worried by your long absence. It was on their behalf that I tracked you, again.<page>Is that so? What a worrying bunch of busybodies they are! I'm still able to fend for meself!<page>Hmph... and yet, perhaps &#8216;tis a warm thing that I remain in their thoughts so. I hadn't expected that. And I can't deny that you too have done me a good turn once more.<page>That awful flock almost had me, truth be told, and I still have to wonder at your intentions, dear one... but bless you, all the same!",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_LIBRARY": "Looking for goodies of your own, dear one? You'd do well to avoid the dark vaults near here. They say the keepers inside were jealous hoarders even before the silken curse came down.<hpage>You have more familiarity with the Citadel than most, madam. How long have you spent here, surviving amongst the haunted corridors?<page>Oh, long enough. S'not such a bad lot, all told. The memories of my pilgrimage have all faded now, but a life spent in the Citadel's golden halls was all I ever wished for.<page>And lo and behold, my humble wish was granted! Certainly, the place might be a bit past its prime, but it'd be churlish of me to complain now, wouldn't it?",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SHELL_FRAGMENT": "Part of an ancient mask, or a fractured shard of someone's visage? With the full thing, you'd be better able to protect your shell. ",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_MEET_ACT3": "What a calamity has befallen our holy Citadel! I ain't never seen anything like it in my long life.<page>Times like this, we must be sure to help each other. Dig deep, dear one, I'll be needing a lot of rosaries to survive what's comin'!",
  "CARETAKER_LV2_MEET": "All your work, and look! They keep arrivin'. It's bugs aplenty up here now. Hapless, weak, but alive they are!<hpage>More scared than weak, they seem to me. It is heartening knowing these few have survived safe for your care.<page>That's your work, bellringer! Not mine. Ringin' and helpin'! Hope they recognise your efforts, &#8216;cause I ain't providing much, and I ain't one for fighting if that Choir and their pins ever come callin'.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_SHOP_REPEAT": "Stop and share some of your rosaries before you go scurrying off again, dear one. I'm sure to have something that's to your liking!",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SPOOLPIECE": "Half a spider's spool. You'd just have to find its match. Them ol' Weavers built some fine things alright. They're all long dead, but their craftwork still gleams bright. ",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_WALLCLING": "A gleaming find for you climbing types. With this in your claw you'll be able to stick to walls for as long as you like!",
  "CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_CHURCHKEEPER": "Down in the mosslands, still clinging to her failed chapel, my sister'll part with her power, if asked kind enough.",

For you, they'll give it, if for their fascination at the act, or the thrill of defiance... or because they have no choice at all.",
  "CARETAKER_LACE_DEFEATED": "<hpage>Sir, I have opened the way above these halls, and bested the white knight that stood as guardian.<hpage>Child of the monarch, she claimed herself at the end, and her shell suggested it true, a being born purely from Silk woven tight. <hpage>That such a feat is possible... I have seen life woven from Silk before, but tiny, transient... Never like this...<page>Aye, bellringer! You've slain a marvel indeed... Well, flawed marvel, at least.<page>One to keep far from she was, least for us mortal sorts. Look of a child and a mind to match, but her's been up wanderin' this Citadel longer'n most. Even in its long silence, way &#8216;fore you came and roused its ire. <page>Might'a seen herself this place's protector, keepin' it clean and quiet as she did. Course quiet meant most crossin' her path found a painful end from her pin.<page>I'd be sayin' thanks for the slaying, but with all the other husks now awoken and enraged, a bug's chances ain't grown by much.",
  "CITY_MERCHANT_MEET": "Hello again, dear one. Looks like we both made it up here, safe as told. And what a shock to find you were speaking the truth about this place!<page>A settlement like this in the Citadel, nice and safe, cloistering so many bugs with minds intact! Never seen anything like it, nor even imagined such.<page>Makes trading away all of my nice bits and baubles much easier.

I see you have a tool pouch of your own there. Full to bursting with baubles and trinkets, no doubt!<page>I'll fit another pocket onto it, so you can carry even more tools and shards with you.

Her down now fills my cloak, and does much to ward against the frost of these heights.<page>To pass something so precious... That's a mighty gift you've been given. Seems she's thrown her lot in with you.<page>I'd not have guessed her so opposed to our threaded monarch, but then she too must have sensed the wretched state of things, and the harsher change to come. ",
  "MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET_ACT3": "Ahh. Old One. Your kind should know it's rude to expose me such. Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. <hpage>I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.<page>Aye. Well its no great shock to have you visit. I've felt, and heard, the effects of your... altercation with the pale mother... The fate for these caverns seems grim.<page>I'll take it things have taken a turn more complicated? Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?<hpage>In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch's desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.<page>Ha! I'm not surprised! It's always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.<hpage>It was freedom I sought, Maker, for myself and for you mortal few. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.",

Watcher, hunter, monarch even, though you may reject that station.<page>A complex visage, perhaps, yet still to my sight it looks unresolved.<hpage>If you see a transitional state, it is one I have accepted. My mask has remained defined through lifetimes uncounted.<page>Aye. Rigid I'm sure, but your kind rarely develop evenly, and the lifetime of bugs are poor measure for one like you.<page>Could be there's more growth awaiting you yet...",

Open the way and let we poor, insignificant little pilgrims crawl into the light...<hpage>I see no gatekeepers to heed your plea, pilgrim, though I too seek entry to the Citadel. Have you heard of a means to open this gateway?<page>Ahh... Weapons blunt it not. No holes for keys. &#8216;Tis the bells, they say! The holy bells upon the path that open the way!",
  "GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_NO_SHRINES": "<hpage>I have passed several such bells, pilgrim. I know how to see them woken.

  "GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_SHRINES": "<hpage>On my journey up, I passed many large bells housed in old shrines. Each I have struck awake, yet still this gate stays closed. What other task must be done to see us pass beyond?<page>The bells are rung? Then this sacred threshold may now be crossed, for the final task is simple! Only music, played fair and true. Music shall attune the bells, and see the gate descend.<page>It must be you to lead us, sister! You, who brought this blessing! Play or sing and we shall follow.",

  "SHERMA_HEALER_MEET": "Welcome back red maiden, and thank you again for coming to my aid.<page>I'm no healer, but with the supplies we found in the ward below even my unlearned claws can ease the suffering of our brothers and sisters.<page>That such darkness could creep into this most holy of places, even though we pilgrims kept our promise to ascend...<page>I confess, I wonder at the meaning of it all.

I was hoping we would meet here, red maiden.<page>Rising at last to the heights of the Citadel and being amongst so many of my brothers and sisters... it is a blessing indeed.

  "COURIER_TALL_THANK_PT1": "Safely-saved is Pill! But who is this rare carer for the shell of another? Name yourself, good bug!<hpage>I am Hornet, Pill. Your brother wished for your return to Bellhart, where he waits now. I'm sure he will be eager to see you alive.<page>Young Tipp! How he worries always.

Know you stand before the honoured knight Garmond, and brave companion Zaza.<page>Together, Zaza and I are wish bound to scale this Citadel, and vanquish the horrors at its heart!<hpage>Then good luck to you, sir bug. It is heartening to meet another of sound mind and fortitude enough to fight back against the many haunted husks.<page>Aye! Never-ending, these unnatural opponents!

All o'that learning, all o'that strength... sucked up in a whirl of Silk.<page=M>We'd call you a thief, Old One, and cruel for the taking, but its all coming down soon if you can't stop it.<page=M>If there's advantage in your act that might see these caves safe, then it's better you make your claim.",

I shall do what I must.",

Even as the dark eats its outer, she will spin its Silk anew.<hpage>The effort would be immense and it will strain her soul thin, but what other choice remains?<hpage>This is the desperate act of a dying god. A defiance that, left unchallenged, will bring your kingdom's ruin. ",

With the way cleared I can return under my own guidance.<page>After all, what's another pilgrimage, eh? Ha ha!<page>Oh! And I have something for you as well. I found it buried amongst the broken relics down here in the darkness, glowing with a pale light.<page>'Tis an odd-looking thing... not exactly holy-seeming... but I would be honoured if you accepted it all the same!",

  "MAPPER_CALLED": "Poshanka! So you found my calling ring, Child Wielding Needle. I recognised the sound of your weapon's foreign metal against it.<page>On the hunt for my master, I am often away, but I still use this place as camp. Use the ring to call me whenever you wish to make trade.",

If you would oppose the minions of this Citadel, you have my respect.<page>Hmph. Then we share a rare stance, warrior. Few others seem possessed of will enough to resist.<page>So many weak minds, drawn up and strung, in love with the great golden leech atop their lands.",
  "GARMOND_CITADEL_MEET": "Ho there, brave sister! What poetry has fate writ, that we should meet here at the peak of this ghastly Citadel!<page>Beasts and fiends, all here are lost to that horrid Haunting! And out from this golden corpse it seeps to plague the good bugs of the land below. Well, no more we say!<hpage>You should beware brave sirs, the creature that commands this curse is a foe far beyond bug. I would not see your lives given in vain.<page>Pah! We beware nothing! We would give our lives a hundred times over to finally cut away the evil that clutches our kingdom!",
  "GILLY_MEET_HIDDEN": "Goodness! This is just too embarrassing! Detected even through my perfect cover! What tell? What error? Surely something gave me away!<hpage>It was no one thing, young bug. Your disguise is near faultless. I've merely spent a long life being watchful.<page>Gah! Then I'll just have to hope the beasts about don't share such keen sight. It'll be so much harder to accomplish my work if I'm detected, or eaten!",
  "GARMOND_AID_ACCEPT": "<hpage>The battle ahead may indeed be arduous. I accept your offer of aid, sirs.<page>Gurrrro! Yes! No force in the kingdom can withstand our might! Lead on, sister! Zaza and I will be close behind!",

If ever it sprouted in our lands we would surely have known?<hpage>I would not seek it in these lands. I need its power full, and it is too fragile to sustain here long. I would seek it in my memory.<page=S> Oh ho ho! So you'd have us wrench open your soul, to retrieve the fabled bloom? Can such a thing be done?<hpage>For another bug, no, but I am Weaver enough to attempt it.<hpage>In the distant past, I knew the flower. My thread still holds its faint memory. If the Everbloom was grasped strongly enough within my Silk, it could be made to manifest.<page=M>Ah! So you're asking another spell of us? To reveal the flower clear?...

To our young we tell the tales, but had thought them long dead, only corpses bound in spires. <hpage>This one still lived, though if it was a Weaver, it was broken in a savage way.<hpage>Its own Silk was bound, pinned deep within its shell.

Fairly said, sister.<page>I must confess something though. Truth is, I already lost the last of my rosaries. I can't pay our last wager.<page>I do have something small for you, at least. These dice.

My wish granted before ever I arrived...<hpage>The bronze pair that danced this chamber, it is clear, tall bug, how closely they mimicked your shell. Was it you who provided their inspiration?<page>Not I, warrior. For this place, my heart holds only loathing...<page>The dancers... they were the last free act of my partner... Always hopeful. Always naive.<page>His whole he gave, in desperate trade to see our own caves left safe. His shell and soul became the mould.<page>So long, I dared not visit... Even as our lands fell to thread and ruin... Instead I wasted, a coward caged, too weak to witness his grace bound in parody so cruel.<hpage>Take some solace, tall bug. His soul is now free from that shell of iron, and the fate that befell your lands, this Citadel too has been claimed full by it.<page>Aye...

That's an unexpected heart you're holding, Old One...<page=M>We can guess to its source, though we'd believed it long gone from these lands. <hpage>The heart of a graceful lord. In its taking I was able to witness his caves and kingdom as once they flourished.<hpage>A stunning sight. Unique. All gone... Lost to the pale monarch... and the system to keep her caged.",

Together we will face bold to any challenge!<hpage>I have no wish to fight you, sir bug. It is heartening to meet another on these roads of sound mind, and with fortitude enough to fight back against the haunted husks.<page>Aye! Too many, these unnatural opponents! We did hope Pharloom's vast expanse would still possess some place free of that tainted thread. <page>Alas, so far we've encountered only violence and decay. We greatly fear the Haunting afflicts this kingdom all.",
  "MAPPER_MEET_BRIEF": "Poshanka! Edges sharp and senses keen!<page>In my land, that is the way warriors greet each other. For though you are a child barely hatched, you are also a warrior.

The bell housed within seems to provide some sanctuary from the dangers of the Haunting.<hpage>Your brother and sister pilgrims who now huddle around it would be glad of your company, I am sure.<page>Oh, how wonderful! Yes, I will make my way over there with haste... after I have bathed a little longer. I want to arrive fresh and clean to such a holy place!",

Now arrived, I find it free, and its few remaining residents offering trade and welcome.<hpage>I slew a tall creature above the town, a Weaver I suspect, though one twisted in purpose.<hpage>It was her you may have sensed. A formidable force, even aged. By voice and claw she aided, perhaps guided, the haunted thread that grasps these lands. <page>Weaver? Those vicious things. To our young we tell the tales, but had thought them long dead, only corpses bound in spires. <hpage>This one still lived, though if it was a Weaver, it was broken in a savage way.<hpage>Its own Silk was bound, pinned deep within its shell. A cruel punishment I've not before witnessed. <page>Even broken, my envy remains. A Weaver's fabled skills... To meet one in combat means great challenge, and great pride in victory.",

Neither you nor your land have proven my match. This sleeping Citadel shall be no different.<page>Spider, dear. Why must you remain so distressingly... optimistic? The power that waits above, you cannot conceive, her who would snuff that hope with barely a glance.<hpage>Fool child. You still think me blind to the form of your liege? Having coming this far?<hpage>This land's grandeur, the devotion of its bugs, and the curse that befalls them. The signs are clear.<hpage>Your kingdom is in the thrall of a creature beyond bug, one of that higher caste.<hpage>Whatever its desire for my Silk and my shell, it shall find I'm quite attached to both.",
  "SHERMA_CORAL_JUDGE": "Aren't those solemn judge-bugs nice? They do not speak or sing, but I sense great wisdom behind their gleaming gazes!<hpage>Beware them, little one. Wise or not, their judgements are often followed by violence. Many of your fellow pilgrims have fallen to them on these great steps.<page>Oh...?

  "GREEN_PRINCE_CLOVER_MEET_1": "Warrior... I heard your approach. Why do you come? Surely you've no desire to see these long collapsed caves?<hpage>The way was open, sir. I merely followed the path through. Am I correct to guess you were once a resident of these borderlands?<page>Aye... and glorious they were, in their time. Pharloom's end approaches, but my caves, these caves, fell to fate long before. <page>Of that fair land, I am the last... Now to remain till the end, and remember the splendour that was...",

Remember, ours is a kingdom of wishes granted.<page=B>Pharloom was not born of that monarch, Old One. Power existed in these lands even before she bound them beneath her.<page=B>Grnk.

So pretty! So warm!<page>But when Nuu tried to crawl near, the flames became angry and swooped all around! Poor Nuu was half roasted!<page>Nuu leaves it to you, miss grown-up, to climb up there and cut those flames apart. For our journal, such must be done.",

I feel she was here only recently!<hpage>I cannot say for certain, Shakra, though if she travels seeking skilled opponents, these steps would serve her well. The warriors watching over them are formidable.<page>True! Impressive guardians they are, fighting defensively and loath to leave their stations. They swing their weapons with a cold brutality that should not be underestimated.",
  "MAPPER_MASTER_MEET": "Poshanka, Hornet Wielding Needle. For that is your name, is it not? I have heard it spoken in this land with reverence.<page>I had hoped you would accept my summons. In these moments one is good, but two is best.<hpage>I would not deny the wish, Shakra. A sombre ceremony seemed likely at this trail's end, and I am sadly proved correct. This then is your master?<page>The fiercest of my tribe, here she lies. I called her master, true, but she was mother just as much, more by far than the bug who bore me.<hpage>Among the many marvels of this kingdom, she found a fine place to meet her end.<page>Ended by age... My tribe would call that shame, but I see only strength unbeaten.<page>Even as her shell betrayed her, she walked this kingdom's breadth. It was her trail followed that allowed me to share witness to its dignity.<page>Hornet Wielding Needle, you too have journeyed these many paths, as my master before us. Join me now for her song-sending.<page>It is time for her soul to walk beyond her shell...",

I hope in my excitement I did not... hoof... bring down my lance too heavy upon you, sister.<hpage>It was combat honourably conducted, sirs. But now, we should all of us keep moving.

Just one final, brutal climb, hm?<hpage>The Citadel is near, pilgrim. You must have had some strength in you. Few of your fellows seem to reach these heights.<page>Aye, the roads become lonelier the longer they're travelled and the higher we climb.<page>It takes a lot of luck and a lot of faith to make it this far, though I'm sure I don't need to tell you that.",

  "HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_COMPLETE_4": "Nuu's wish, it is granted. But miss grown-up will continue cutting creatures and adding them to our journal, of course?<hpage>I will. Knowing a creature's form and habits is an advantage that can decide the outcome of a battle. Recording these details is worth the effort.<page>Oh yes! Is very much worth it! Nuu hopes you will share your new learnings with her often!<page>And take a gift to help with your huntings, miss grown-up! Nuu will add a pocket to your tool pouch, for the bringing of many tools on your hunts!<page>",

So many skills I cannot recall learning... <page>But do not underplay your own achievements, for they too are significant, inspiring even!<page>In fact, for my deep respect I insist you take this small medallion.

Warm yourself by my lantern while I call. <hpage>Pharloom is a land of harsh extremes. Perhaps that is, in part, why the pilgrims have a culture of testing themselves against it so fervently.<page>Perhaps.

Yes, my wandering was long and I began to fear I would meet my end in those sticky swamps below.<page>How lucky I was to stumble upon the home of these friendly revellers!<page>They said I could be a flea here with them, so of course I agreed.

Having coming this far?<hpage>This land's grandeur, the devotion of its bugs, and the curse that befalls them. The signs are clear.<hpage>Your kingdom is in the thrall of a creature beyond bug, one of that higher caste.<hpage>Whatever its desire for my Silk and my shell, it shall find I'm quite attached to both.",

At last!<hpage>I was intrigued by the challenge you issued on the bell settlement's wishwall, sir, though having reached this place I wonder at your choice of location.<hpage>If you seek challengers you should choose somewhere less far afield. It is rare chance any bug would journey to a cavern so distant.<page>True, perhaps. Though once discovered, could there be a more perfect spot? This giant, boney body, so distant from Pharloom's ails.<page>Here, freely, we can test our speed and our sleek shells. Here we may race!<page>You must be eager to step to the task, challenger?

The red-shells are plentiful here, stalking these vast grassy plains and the last of its boney beasts.<page>Compared to the caves below, this lush growth feels even greater. Have we crawled close to the source of their sustenance?<page>I must discover its secret! I will! By my father's wish, and for hope that our dying lands might find means to endure.<hpage>Just be careful, young one. I urge you. Here you've reached the ants' heart-domain.<hpage>There may be discoveries worth making, but a single mistake will see your shell's sharp end.",

The great gate heard my song and, in its infinite and ancient kindness, opened the way forward for us!<page>What luck, for us to meet at this moment!

So many are hurt or exhausted!<hpage>Your doubts and worries will not heal them, little one.<hpage>If you would aid your fellows, you can start by dressing their wounds.

Why destroy something so vital? <hpage>It is a difficult thing to explain simply... A test was needed, to ensure my strength before a greater challenge soon to come.<hpage>Know, in time, these caves may see opportunity to regrow, flourish even, though that rebirth is itself a task enormous... longer than a lifetime, many lifetimes.<hpage>For that task to succeed, it will fall to bugs like you to sow the first seeds.",

For her, you would seek Pharloom's many fabulous bugs and cut them.<page>Cut them with your blade! Cut them with your mature spirit! Cut them with your savage adult heart!<page>Would you help Nuu? Could you take her scroll, and fill its pages with the learnings of your cuts?",
  "GARMOND_MEET": "Guurroooo! Scoundrel! Fiend! Who dares wake brave Garmond from his well needed kip?<hpage>I've no intent to disturb, sir bug. I am merely passing these towers and sought to better understand the lay of the place.<page>Hmmph! Knowing the battlefield? A warrior's reason! Just look at you! Your stance and blade, almost alone they declare a fight.<page>As the bravest of knights, if direct challenge were offered, honour would see noble Garmond accept!<page>Fortunate that seems not your intent.

You have not yielded to despair, so some hope must still remain?<hpage>...Slim hope, I suspect. But true, there may yet be a way through this disaster.

Search over from here, on side where the moss meets the nest. There my mothers built their tools, all traps and bindings. Small things, but tests for larger forms.<page>I still remember their thoughts as they worked, their desperation, and their hunger. Another hopeless attempt to wrest their freedom. All ended in failure, of course.",

I shall prove your faith in the meeting ahead.<page>Aye. Bring your best, bellringer. Call forth our great pale god. Cut her weak, then drive the beast down atop the snare.<page>Contact made will stir the snare alight, but only your needle's song will awaken the spell in full.

To leave would be my death, an uninspired end, though one I've sometimes wished would come.<page>I am unique, you see. My mothers shared the curse of their tribe, to conceive a child is a painful, near impossible task. <hpage>I know the curse well, Eva, for I am also it's victim, and spawn of one who managed to overcome its limits. <hpage>Are you too an attempt to defy that cruel constraint?<page>A flawed attempt. A life spun from rune and shell, sustained only by its cage. My thoughts may mimic a Weavers but my senses are my own.<page>Over time, that difference brought only distance between us.",

Soul and Silk inseparably linked.<page>It is a skill almost lost from Pharloom. Those old Weavers shared it, but they're long dead now.<hpage>The one atop this kingdom...

You must rely on your own strength and skill to survive.<page>I have neither! If what you say is true, I may as well crawl outside and let myself be devoured right now.

In Pharloom, yours is a rare skill, prized beyond measure, to channel one's soul within a thread. Soul and Silk inseparably linked.<page>It is a skill almost lost from Pharloom.
